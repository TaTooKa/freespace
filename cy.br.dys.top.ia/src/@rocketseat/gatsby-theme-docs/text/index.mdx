# cy.br/dys.top.ia RPG - Introduction

Welcome to the <span class="fuchsia bold">cy.br</span>/<span class="turquoise bold">dys.top.ia</span> !

## WHAT IS THIS?

This is a tabletop RPG. It's meant to be played around a table, alone or with friends. But instead of using pencils and sheets of paper, each player should have a device capable of browsing this website (smartphone, tablet, notebook, etc), and some dice (this game uses <span class="turquoise bold">d%</span>'s).

> If you are new to the game, read the [HOW TO PLAY](/rules/how-to-play) section!

### website sections

Your **CHARACTER** lives in the topmost section of the menu: See the [STATS](/character-stats) and [TRAITS](/character-traits) pages. There's also the [CHALLENGES](/challenges) section for you to track your Challenges and their progress.

Next is [PROMPTS](/prompts/general-prompts): the bread and butter of this RPG system. They are grouped by prompt type.

And there's also the [ORACLES](/oracles/core-oracles): Random tables of all sort of cyberpunk content to help the imagination juices flow.

Finally, the [RULES REFERENCE](/rules/general-rules) section is meant to be read when you forget how some of the rules or mechanics work. If you haven't played before, read through the [HOW TO PLAY](/rules/how-to-play) section.
