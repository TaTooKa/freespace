# cy.br/dys.top.ia RPG - Introduction

Welcome to the <span class="fuchsia bold">cy.br</span>/<span class="turquoise bold">dys.top.ia</span> !

## WHAT IS THIS?

This is a tabletop RPG. It's meant to be played around a table, alone or with friends. Each player should have a device capable of browsing this website (smartphone, tablet, notebook, etc), and some dice (this game uses <span class="turquoise bold">d%</span>'s).

### website sections

Your **CHARACTER** lives in the topmost section of the menu: See the STATS and TRAITS pages. There's also the CHALLENGES section for you to track your Challenges and their progress.

Next is PROMPTS: the bread and butter of this RPG system. They are grouped by prompt type.

And there's also the ORACLES: Random tables of all sort of cyberpunk content to help the imagination juices flow.

Finally, the RULES REFERENCE section is meant to be scanned if you forget how some of the rules or mechanics work. If you haven't played before, read through the HOW TO PLAY section.
