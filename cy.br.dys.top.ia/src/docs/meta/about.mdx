# ABOUT THIS GAME

<span class="fuchsia bold">cy.br</span>/<span class="turquoise bold">dys.top.ia</span> is a tabletop RPG reference document, interactive character sheet and rules' manual all in one, in website format.
It is designed specifically to be played around a table with friends, each using a device (smartphone, tablet, notebook, etc) to record their character, and roll real dice (you will need several d100s, or d%s).

...But it can also be played remotely through the internet, using a videoconference app and a web-browser.

<span class="fuchsia bold">cy.br</span>/<span class="turquoise bold">dys.top.ia</span> resides towards the narrative side of the RPG system spectrum, with fail-forward mechanics and a fiction-first dogma.

The game can be played in solitary mode, or with others (GM-less or with a GM).
