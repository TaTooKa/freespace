<br/>

<br/>

&nbsp;<span class="turquoise bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: You achieve what you set out to do.
- If you are _IN CONTROL_, [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress). 
- If you are _IN A BAD SPOT_, you do it ([MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress)) but with a cost: [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES (minor)](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences).

> If <span class="turquoise bold">CRITICAL</span>, also choose one: <br/>
‣ gain (or give) a <span class="boost">BOOST</span> to a future related action.<br/>
‣ You are now _IN CONTROL_. <br/>
‣ avoid to [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences) if you are _IN A BAD SPOT_. 

<br/>

## LEAD THE TEAM
⋗ **When you act as a leader for a group effort in which your allies participate...** <br/>choose your approach; you and each participant will test that stat.<br/>

- Gain (or give) a <span class="boost">BOOST</span> to a future related action
- [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress)
- You (or one of the other participants) are _IN CONTROL_
- Reduce the severity by one if you have to [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES (X)](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences) for an ally that failed.

then, if any of the other participants obtained a <span class="fuchsia bold">FAILURE</span>, you are _IN A BAD SPOT_ (If you already were or there was more than one <span class="fuchsia bold">FAILURE</span>, then you must [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES (X)](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences) where X is the amount of remaining <span class="fuchsia bold">FAILURES</span>).

> If <span class="turquoise bold">CRITICAL</span>, pick another of the options above for each <span class="turquoise bold">SUCCESS</span> the other participants obtained (minimum of one).

<br/>

&nbsp;<span class="fuchsia bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: Whatever you intended to do didn't work as planned, or it does but with grave consequences.<br/>

For each <span class="fuchsia bold">FAILURE</span> the other participants obtained, choose an option (minimum of one):
- you are _IN A BAD SPOT_.
- you gain a <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCH">GLITCH</span> for your next test.
- you [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences) (can be taken multiple times by increasing the severity)


> If <span class="fuchsia bold">CRITICAL</span>, each ally that failed must [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES (minor)](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences) and is in _A BAD SPOT_ (if they already were, they gain a <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCH">GLITCH</span> for their next test).

## GATHER INFORMATION
⋗ **When you search for clues, conduct an investigation, analyze evidence, or do research,** test your <Stat name="BRAIN"/>.

&nbsp;<span class="turquoise bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: you discover something helpful and specifific.  The path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear. Envision what you learn ([QUERY THE FATES](/prompts/fate-prompts#query-the-fates) if unsure). Then gain (or give) a <span class="boost">BOOST</span> when acting upon it.

> If <span class="turquoise bold">CRITICAL</span>, also choose one: <br/>
‣ Your findings puts you back on track: You are _IN CONTROL_. <br/>
‣ The discovery is a breakthrough in itself: [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress).

<br/>

&nbsp;<span class="fuchsia bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines your job.
- If you were _IN CONTROL_, you are now _IN A BAD SPOT_.  
- If you are _IN A BAD SPOT_, [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES (minor)](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences).

 test your <Stat name="SHADE"/>.

<br/>

&nbsp;<span class="turquoise bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: If you are _IN CONTROL_ they'll do what you want or agree to your conditions; If you are _IN A BAD SPOT_ they'll ask for something in exchange: [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES (minor)](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences).
> If <span class="turquoise bold">CRITICAL</span>, choose one: <br/> 
‣ Their assistance bolsters your position: You are _IN CONTROL_. <br/>
‣ Their help advances your goals: [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress).

<br/>

 &nbsp;<span class="fuchsia bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: If you are _IN CONTROL_, their agreement comes with a severe condition or complication: [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES (serious)](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences). If you are _IN A BAD SPOT_, they outright refuse.

<hr/>
<br/>

## USE YOUR GEAR
⋗ **When you check to see if you have a specific helpful item or resource**, as long as your GEAR is 1 or greater, you have it and are ready to use it (it gives _narrative permission_, improves _fictional positioning_ or gives a <span class="boost">BOOST</span> when used).

  - You turn the tables in your favor: you are now _IN CONTROL_.

> If <span class="turquoise bold">CRITICAL</span>, also [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress) again.

<br/>

&nbsp;<span class="fuchsia bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: The fight turns against you or the opposition dominates the exchange. 
- If you were _IN CONTROL_, [PAY THE CONSEQUENCES (minor)](/prompts/fate-prompts#pay-the-consequences) and you are now _IN A BAD SPOT_.
