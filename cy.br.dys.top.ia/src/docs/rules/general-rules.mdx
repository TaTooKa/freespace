# RULES REFERENCE

## GAME MODES
This game can be played in **SOLO**, **COOP** or **GUIDED** mode.

The player(s) say what their character(s) do and describe their actions in the fiction. When a **PROMPT** is triggered, they <u>must follow</u> the directives on it.

In **GUIDED** mode, the *GUIDE* decides what happens with everything other than the player characters (NPCs, the environment, etc), and adjudicates the consequences of the player characters’ actions (especially when there is a <span class="fuchsia bold">FAILURE</span> in their tests).

In **SOLO** or **COOP** mode, all players adjudicate the outcomes of tests and the actions and reactions of NPCs and the environment (either as a discussion or by taking turns).

> As a rule of thumb, each player has final say on the descriptions of actions and outcomes of their own character, but they <u>must follow</u> the directives on each **PROMPT**.
<br/>

## DICE TESTS

When required to test a **STAT** (<span class="stat">BRAIN, CHROME, EDGE, FLASH </span><span>or</span> <span class="stat">SHADE</span>), roll d100 against that value. If equal or under, it’s a <span class="turquoise bold">SUCCESS</span>. If over that value, it’s a <span class="fuchsia bold">FAILURE</span>.

A match of units and tens is a **CRITICAL** (<span class="turquoise bold">SUCCESS</span> or <span class="fuchsia bold">FAILURE</span>), meaning that the result is greatly exacerbated, for good or ill. On top of that, a 01 is always a <span class="turquoise bold">CRITICAL SUCCESS</span> and a 100 is always a <span class="fuchsia bold">CRITICAL FAILURE</span>.

> Note that some tests are made against a *challenge value* instead of a **STAT** (like in the case of [FULFILL A CHALLENGE](/prompts/challenge-prompts#fulfill-a-challenge) or [RETIRE](/prompts/fate-prompts#retire)).
<br/>

## BOOSTS AND GLITCHES
A <span class="boost">BOOST</span> is an advantage or edge you get for a test.  A <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCH">GLITCH</span> is the opposite; a disadvantage or a bad condition that lowers your chances for a test.

Sometimes you’ll be given one or more <span class="boost">BOOSTS</span> or <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCHES">GLITCHES</span> for a test. When this happens:
- tally all <span class="boost">BOOSTS</span> and <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCHES">GLITCHES</span> and cancel each other 1:1 (If you had the same amount of <span class="boost">BOOSTS</span> and <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCHES">GLITCHES</span>, they cancel each other for a regular d100 roll).
- Then, if you have any <span class="boost">BOOSTS</span> or <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCHES">GLITCHES</span> remaining, roll an extra d% (the tens die) for each <span class="boost">BOOST</span> or <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCH">GLITCH</span>, and keep the best one if you had <span class="boost">BOOSTS</span>, or the worst one if you had <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCHES">GLITCHES</span>.
- To keep “the best one” or “the worst one” means that you get to pick the lowest result OR the one that would guarantee a <span class="turquoise bold">CRITICAL SUCCESS</span> in the case of a <span class="boost">BOOSTS</span>; and you keep the highest result OR the one that would net you a <span class="fuchsia bold">CRITICAL FAILURE</span> in the case of a <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCH">GLITCH</span>.

> Note that you still always roll one die for the units (important to compare in case of **CRITICALS**, since the odds increase for each d% added).
<br/>

## CHARACTER STATE
Your character can be in one of two states:

*<span class="turquoise bold">IN CONTROL</span>* or *<span class="fuchsia bold">IN A BAD SPOT</span>*.

This represents an overall state that is self-explanatory: You either have command over a situation or the general narrative (you have *the upper hand*), or you are at a disadvantageous position or stumbling, and things can go wrong at any moment.

This state has diegetic significance that changes your *fictional positioning* (envision your actions and descriptions accordingly), but it also has mechanical implications: Some of the **PROMPTS** will have different outcomes whether you are *IN CONTROL* or *IN A BAD SPOT*, and they can also alter your state depending on the result of your dice.
<br/>

## CHALLENGES
Challenges have a progress value that goes from 1 to 99.

They also have a rank, that determines how long they take (how much progress you make when advancing towards your objective):

- <span class="turquoise bold">SHORT</span>: Progress by increments of <span class="turquoise bold">+30%</span> (it takes 4 progress to maximize chances). It nets 2 XP when fulfilled.
- <span class="turquoise bold">MEDIUM</span>: Progress by increments of <span class="turquoise bold">+20%</span> (it takes 5 progress to maximize chances). It nets 5 XP when fulfilled.
- <span class="turquoise bold">LONG</span>: Progress by increments of <span class="turquoise bold">+10%</span> (it takes 10 progress to maximize chances). It nets 10 XP when fulfilled.
- <span class="turquoise bold">EXTREME</span>: Progress by increments of <span class="turquoise bold">+5%</span> (it takes 20 progress to maximize chances). It nets 20 XP when fulfilled.
- <span class="turquoise bold">EPIC</span>: Progress by increments of <span class="turquoise bold">+2%</span> (it takes 50 progress to maximize chances). It nets 50 XP when fulfilled.

> Whenever there is a need for an *involved scene* (a chase scene, an action sequence, a combat encounter, a hacking duel, etc), you should [ACCEPT A CHALLENGE](/prompts/challenge-prompts#accept-a-challenge) (if the obstacle or narrative beat can be resolved with a single action, then you don’t need a challenge).

- When a challenge begins, its value starts at 01%.
- When you are instructed to [MAKE PROGRESS](/prompts/challenge-prompts#make-progress), you add the corresponding increment to the Challenge value.  It cannot go over 99%.
- When you want to [FULFILL A CHALLENGE](/prompts/challenge-prompts#fulfill-a-challenge), you have to roll a d100. If the result is lower or equal than the Challenge value, you succeed. If it’s higher, you fail. 
- A result of 100 is always a failure; a result of 01 is always a success.

<br/>

## CHARACTER CREATION 
- Think of a concept for your character. Then give them a name (or use [an oracle](/oracles/character-oracles#name)).
- Set their **XP current/total** to 0/0.
- Set their status to “*IN CONTROL*”.
- Distribute the following values however you like among your [**STATS**](/character-stats): 60, 50, 40, 30, 20.
- Set your **GRIT**, **PSYCHE** and **GEAR** to 5.
- Choose your **ANGLE** from the options provided. Your **ANGLE** is the objective you want to accomplish before you [RETIRE](/prompts/fate-prompts#retire). You can flesh it out or give it more details in the *NOTES* section, if you want.
- Choose 3 [TRAITS](/character-traits) from the *SKILLS AND BACKGROUND*, *GEAR AND CYBERWARE* and *CONTACTS* sections.

> If you are playing **SOLO** (or **GUIDED** with a single PC) consider awarding that lone character a starting 50XP bonus to [IMPROVE YOURSELF](/prompts/fate-prompts#improve-yourself) and increase some of their **STATS** or buy some extra **TRAITS** (otherwise the high probability of failures will make your first missions very hard).
<br/>

## BEGINNING A GAME
- All players involved should envision and/or discuss the *cyberpunk setting* they’ll be exploring in the fiction (available tech, major factions and opposition, nature and name of THE CITY, etc).

> The players should create their characters together and decide what they do and why they are together, working as a team.

- Each character has their own objectives, defined by their **ANGLE**, and that’s what each of them should be pursuing (they can decide to directly help each other or not). The **ANGLE** works as an *EPIC challenge*, meaning that it will take lots of attempts for each character to progress and eventually fulfill it.  Once all of that’s clear, envision an inciting incident, [ACCEPT A CHALLENGE](/prompts/challenge-prompts#accept-a-challenge) and get to work on it.
<br/>

## ENDING A GAME 
- this game can be played <span class="turquoise bold">indefinitely</span> (i.e. you can [RETIRE](/prompts/fate-prompts#retire) a character and continue playing with a new one, but the main plot or the overarching story continues),
- ...or it can be played with <span class="turquoise bold">a set destination</span> (i.e. when every character retires or dies, the game is over),
- ...or it can also be played <span class="turquoise bold">as a one-shot</span>, in which a single short story plays out and then the game ends.

<u>The decision is up to the players</u>.
