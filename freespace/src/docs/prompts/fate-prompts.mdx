# FATE PROMPTS

## PAY THE CONSEQUENCES
⋗ **When you suffer the outcome of a mechanical or narrative <span class="fuchsia">FAILURE</span>**, choose one (If a prompt specified X as `minor|serious|major` or you obtained a <span class="fuchsia bold">CRITICAL FAILURE</span>, make it worse or choose more than one):

- Trigger a prompt that makes sense for your actions: [ENDURE HARM (X)](/prompts/suffer-prompts#endure-harm), [ENDURE STRESS (X)](/prompts/suffer-prompts#endure-stress) or [SACRIFICE RESOURCES (X)](/prompts/suffer-prompts#sacrifice-resources).
- Make the most obvious negative narrative outcome happen.
- [QUERY THE FATES](/prompts/fate-prompts#query-the-fates) for inspiration. Interpret the answer as a hardship or complication appropriate to the situation.
- Choose (or roll) one of the following outcomes as inspiration:

| RANDOM OUTCOMES | |

## IMPROVE YOURSELF
⋗ **When you have some spare time and XP and want to improve yourself or your assets**, envision how you gain your new benefits and spend your XP as follows:

    Can’t increase greater than 99.
- <span class="turquoise bold">Gain a new TRAIT</span>: Each costs 20 XP.

<br/>

## RETIRE
⋗ **When you consider it’s a good time to retire**, test against your CHARACTER ARC challenge progress value.

&nbsp;<span class="turquoise bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: You successfully fulfill your CHARACTER ARC.

Envision and describe this final fate however you see fit, then <span class="turquoise bold">retire your character</span> (they turn into an NPC, leave to a better place, die honorably, etc).

> If you create a new character that was close to this one, or somehow inherited their gear or wisdom, they start with 50 XP.<br/><br/>
> If <span class="turquoise bold">CRITICAL</span>, they start with 100 XP instead.

&nbsp;<span class="fuchsia bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: You utterly fail at achieving your CHARACTER ARC.

Envision how this develops negatively or your objective falls just out of reach. Then <span class="fuchsia bold">retire your character</span> (they turn into an NPC, leave to a better place, die honorably, etc).

> If you create a new character that was close to this one, or somehow inherited their gear or wisdom, they start with 25 XP.
