# SUFFER PROMPTS

## ENDURE HARM

⋗ **When you face physical injury, fatigue, or illness**, suffer <span class="fuchsia bold">-1 GRIT</span> for minor harm, <span class="fuchsia bold">-2 GRIT</span> for serious harm, or <span class="fuchsia bold">-3 GRIT</span> for major harm.

Then, **if your GRIT is 0 or you choose to resist the harm**, test your <Stat name="CHROME"/>.

&nbsp;<span class="turquoise bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: You shake it off. Gain a <span class="boost">BOOST</span> for your next test. 

> If <span class="turquoise bold">CRITICAL</span>, also gain **+1 GRIT**.

&nbsp;<span class="fuchsia bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: You are in pain. Gain a <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCH">GLITCH</span> for your next test. 

> If <span class="fuchsia bold">CRITICAL</span>, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer another **-1 GRIT**.

Then, **if your GRIT is still 0**, roll on the table below (if you are *IN A BAD SPOT* you gain a <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCH">GLITCH</span> to this roll):

| RESULT | |
| :---: | --- |
| 01-25 | You are still standing, somehow. |
| 26-40 | You are reeling. You gain a <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCH">GLITCH</span> to all tests for the remainder of this scene. |
| 41-60 | You are unconscious and out of action. If left alone, you come back to your senses in an hour or two. If you are vulnerable to ongoing harm, [FACE DEATH](/prompts/suffer-prompts#face-death). |
| 61-75 | You are dying. Within an hour or two, you must [HEAL](/prompts/recovery-prompts#heal) and raise your **GRIT** above 0, or [FACE DEATH](/prompts/suffer-prompts#face-death). |
| 76-00 | You have suffered mortal harm. [FACE DEATH](/prompts/suffer-prompts#face-death). |

| 26-50 | You give in to desperation and in an act of rashness you attempt to [FULFILL A CHALLENGE](/prompts/challenge-prompts#fulfill-a-challenge) now, no matter how low or high its progress value is. |
| 51-75 | You give in to fear or compulsion or act against your better instincts (gaining a <span class="glitch" data-text="GLITCH">GLITCH</span> to all tests on this scene), or give up ([FAIL A CHALLENGE](/prompts/challenge-prompts#fail-a-challenge) automatically). |
| 76-00 | You are overwhelmed or severely traumatized. [FACE DESOLATION](/prompts/suffer-prompts#face-desolation). |
